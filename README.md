# vipr-bkup
Remote Tool to backup EMC ViPR/CoprHD internal database data

Preliminary Plan:
  Create a tool that requests a new backupset to be created in the ViPR Controller Instance, after which the backupset will be downloaded and stored in a location specified by the user of the tool.
  
  This will leverage the ViPR REST API as documented for ViPR version 2.3
